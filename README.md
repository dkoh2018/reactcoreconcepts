# nextjs learning environment

this is just an environment for me to learn all about nextjs and implement backend functionality. this project serves as a playground for exploring the features and capabilities of next.js, a powerful react framework for building modern web applications.

i'll be:

- diving deep into next.js core concepts
- implementing server-side rendering (ssr) and static site generation (ssg)
- exploring api routes and serverless functions
- experimenting with data fetching methods
- implementing authentication and authorization
- working with databases and orm tools
- optimizing performance and implementing best practices
- testing various deployment strategies

this readme will be updated as i progress
